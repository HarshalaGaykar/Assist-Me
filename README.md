# AI-Powered Assistive Technologies for Individuals with Disabilities

## Overview
This project is an AI-driven multi-assistive system designed to enhance accessibility for individuals with visual, speech, and mobility impairments. It integrates various AI-powered functionalities to provide a seamless experience for users with disabilities.

## Features
- **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Converts spoken words into text for communication assistance.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Reads out text-based content for visually impaired users.
- **To-Do Application:** A simple, voice-controlled task management system.
- **Smart Wheelchair Simulation:** Uses voice commands and gestures to navigate a simulated wheelchair.
- **Sign Language Recognition:** Converts sign language gestures into text or speech to aid communication.

## Technologies Used
### Programming Languages
- **Python** – AI models, OCR, Text-to-Speech, and Computer Vision.
- **JavaScript (React, TypeScript)** – Web-based user interface.

### Frameworks & Libraries
- **Flask** – Backend framework to handle AI-based requests.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** – AI model training and inference.
- **OpenCV** – Real-time object detection and image processing.
- **Tesseract OCR** – Text extraction from images.
- **Liblouis** – Braille translation.
- **Pygame** – Smart wheelchair simulation and AI-based navigation.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** – Object and environment recognition.
- **Gazebo** – Simulation of smart wheelchair navigation.
